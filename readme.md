[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/bueltge/must-use-loader/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/bueltge/must-use-loader) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a73ec78af2ea4026ffb1/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/bueltge/must-use-loader/maintainability) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/bueltge/must-use-loader/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/bueltge/must-use-loader)

This small plugin scan and include all plugins in subdirectories from the Must Use plugin folder.

## Description
The WordPress Must Use Plugins are acceptable to include without doings in the back end. But WordPress does not load plugins in subdirectories. They must be at the root of the  Must Use plugin directory, on default `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`. This small plugin scan includes all plugins in subdirectories from the Must Use plugin folder.

The plugin has a simple cache, and you flush this cache if you go to the network plugin page; view is enough.
